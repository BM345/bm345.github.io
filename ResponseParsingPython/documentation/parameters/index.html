                <h1>Validation Parameters</h1>
                <p>
                    This document describes the validation parameters that are used in Nagwa content.</p>
                <p>
                    Validation parameters are a set of parameters that determine how a student must write their answer for a given question.</p>
                <p>
                    Validation parameters often deal with <i>different ways of writing the same thing</i>. For example, '23' and '023' are different ways of writing the same number, and we may want to accept both of them as the right answer to a question.</p>
                <p>
                    Different parameter values can be set for each question. While most of the time you will probably want to use the default value of each parameter, sometimes you will want to change them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document describes what the different values are, and what effect they have.

                    The <i>primary type</i> of an answer is what <i>kind</i> of mathematical expression it is. Some examples are: an integer, a decimal, a fraction, a surd, a complex number, an inequality, a single word, et c.

                    The primary type affects what parameters can be set for a question. For example, a parameter that can be set for the decimal type is 'Must have exactly n decimal places', which requires the student to give an answer that has n decimal places, but this parameter obviously can't be set for the integer type, because integers have no decimal places.

                    NOTE: There are many questions in our content that have answers like '9.6 km/s' or '12 mph' (i.e., a number with a unit after it). This is common in mechanics content in maths, and of course throughout physics. Although these keys have integers and decimals <i>as part of them</i>, they <b>should not</b> be set to the integer or decimal answer types. The integer and decimal answer types are only for questions where the answer is an integer or decimal <b>ONLY</b>. Anything else must have the answer type 'none'. This validation system has so far only been designed to cover a small number of maths questions. The majority of the questions in our content will (for now) have an answer type of 'none', as they are not covered by the validation code.

                    A 'leading zero' is any '0' digit that appears at the start of a number.</p>

                <p>
                    All of the above are valid ways of writing the number 23. Most of the time we would never write '0023' or '00023', but all of the above <i>technically</i> represent the number 23. If the answer to a question were 23, but the student gives their answer as '0023', they are still correct. </p>

                            If it is set to <code>false</code> for a question, then if a student tries to submit an answer to that question like '0023', they will not be allowed to submit the answer, and will be given the message 'You don't need to write zeros at the start of your answer.'
                        </p>

                            Imagine that a student enters '0023' as their answer to a question. (And that 'Allow Leading Zeros' has been set to <code>true</code> for that question.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If 'Remove Leading Zeros' is set to <code>true</code>, then this answer will be converted into '23' before it is compared to the key.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that even if a student <i>does</i> put leading zeros in their answer, it doesn't matter, because we're going to remove them before checking their answer.

                    The most common set of values that you are likely to want to use for the above two parameters are
                </p>
                <table class="examplestable">

                <p>
                    This is the "friendliest" or "nicest" setting. A student can type leading zeros in their answer (if they really want to), but they will automatically be removed before their answer is checked. This way, if a student types '0023', but the key is '23', they won't be "told off" and they won't get the question wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, however, you might want to encourage the student <i>not</i> to write leading zeros. (This would be particularly useful at lower g-values, because we want to encourage young students to write numbers in the conventional way.) In this case, you could set 'Allow Leading Zeros' to <code>false</code> - then if they try to type '0023', they will be told not to write the leading zeros.

                <h2>An exception ...</h2>
                <p>
                    There is one case where most of the time we <i>do</i> want a student to write a leading zero, and that's with decimals between &minus;1 and 1.
                </p>
                <table class="examplestable">
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>0.1</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>0.55</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>0.4298</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    All of the above numbers have <b>one</b> leading zero, and this is generally the preferred way of writing decimals between &minus;1 and 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if 'Allow Leading Zeros' is set to <code>false</code>, students will still be allowed to submit decimals of the form '0._____'. (The leading zero is thought of as a 'phantom' zero.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is a parameter to control whether this zero will be added to a student's answer (if they haven't written it), before their answer is checked against the key.
                </p>
                <h3>'Add a single leading zero to decimals smaller than 1'</h3>
                <p>
                    This parameter can take values of <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is set to <code>true</code> by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If set to <code>true</code>, when a student enters something like '.12' as their answer, it will automatically have a zero added to the front of it, making it '0.12'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If set to <code>false</code>, when a student enters something like '.12' as their answer, no leading zero will be added to it.

                <p>
                    Note that while the leading zeros parameters can be applied to all four of the current primary types, the trailing zeros parameters can only be applied to the decimal type. (Integers don't have trailing zeros.)

                    There is a special parameter for removing this trailing decimal point before the student's answer is compared to the key. This parameter is called 'Remove Trailing Decimal Point'. It can take a value of <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If <code>true</code>, '12.' would be changed to '12'. If false, '12.' would not be changed. It is set to <code>true</code> by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be very unusual to ever need to change this parameter - most of the time we don't want students to write something like '12.' (there are only a few cases where we might).

                    This is the "friendliest" or "nicest" setting. A student can type trailing zeros in their answer (if they really want to), but they will automatically be removed before their answer is checked. This way, if a student types '2.500', but the key is '2.5', they won't be "told off" and they won't get the question wrong.

                <h2>Plus and minus signs</h2>
                <p>
                    When we write negative numbers, we always write a minus sign at the start of the number to indicate that it's negative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we write positive numbers, however, by convention we usually don't write a plus sign at the start of the number to indicate that it's positive. If a number is written without a plus or a minus sign, it's taken to be positive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, writing a positive number with a plus sign is still a valid way of writing a number, even if it's not how we normally write numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we may want to encourage a student not to write a plus sign at the start of a positive number (because we want to encourage them to follow the conventional rules for writing numbers). Other times, we may want them to explicitly write the plus sign (for example, when giving relative charges of particles in physics). And sometimes we may want the allow the student to do either, and have their answer marked correct regardless of whether or not it has the plus sign.

                <h2>Currency Values</h2>
                <p>
                    The <code>currency value</code> primary type is a 'special case' of the <code>decimal</code> primary type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each country and each currency, there are usually conventions for how to write values of that currency. For example, in the UK, we generally don't write '£12.5' or '£12.500' - we would always write '£12.50'. So the <code>currency value</code> type is like the <code>decimal</code> type, but with some extra limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main limitations are around the number of decimal places that must be given for a currency value. For example, if the currency is set to GBP (UK pounds), any answer must be given to zero or two decimal places - if the student tries to submit anything else, they will not be able to submit their answer.
                </p>
                <h3>Which currencies are supported?</h3>
                <p>
                    The table below shows which currencies are currently supported, and what limitations apply to them.

                <h3>Parameters that can't be applied to currency values</h3>
                <p>
                    There are several parameters that can't be applied to currency values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    'Must have at least n decimal places', 'Must have no more than n decimal places', and 'Must have exactly n decimal places' cannot be applied, as these would conflict with the in-built decimal place constraints for each currency. If these parameters are set for a currency value question, they will be ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The significant figure parameters also can't be applied for the same reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the two trailing zero parameters cannot be applied. This is because something like '£12.50', even though it has a trailing zero, is always a valid way of writing this currency value.
                </p>
