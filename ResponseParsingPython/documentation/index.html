                <p>A 'leading zero' is any '0' digit that appears at the start of a number.</p>
                <p>For example</p>

                <p>All of the above are valid ways of writing the number 23. Most of the time we would never write '0023' or '00023', but all of the above <i>technically</i> represent the number 23. If the answer to a question were 23, but the student gives their answer as '0023', they are still correct. </p>

                            Imagine that a student enters '0023' as their answer to a question. (And that 'Allow Leading Zeros' has been set to <code>true</code> for that question.)

                  This is the "friendliest" or "nicest" setting. A student can type leading zeros in their answer (if they really want to), but they will automatically be removed before their answer is checked. This way, if a student types '0023', but the key is '23', they won't be "told off" and they won't get the question wrong. </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, however, you might want to encourage the student <i>not</i> to write leading zeros. (This would be particularly useful at lower g-values, because we want to encourage young students to write numbers in the conventional way.) In this case, you could set 'Allow Leading Zeros' to <code>false</code> - then if they try to type '0023', they will be told not to write the leading zeros.
